# Single Site Exploration and data export
R code to explore the data from WildCo standardised data. The WildCo data standards are detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TP5ZHzp3EVE3SplrgC4mGzqQWly0cmro/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116356192910674281375&rtpof=true&sd=true).

**Note** to run this script on data exported from Wild3 you will first need to run the standardiser script: WildCo_DB_to_Standardized.R 

This script allows you to:

## Plot your camera locations

## Explore detections through time

## Output 'analysis ready' matrices of detections at total, monthly and weekly timescales - based on the independence threshold you provide.
